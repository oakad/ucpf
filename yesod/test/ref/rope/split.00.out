A novice asked the Master: "Here is a programmer that never designs, documents
or tests his programs. Yet all who know him consider him one of the best
programmers in the world. Why is this?"
The Master replies: "That programmer has mastered the Tao. He has gone beyond
the need for design; he does not become angry when the system crashes, but
accepts the universe without concern. He has gone beyond the need for
documentation; he no longer cares if anyone else sees his code. He has gone
beyond the need for testing; each of his programs are perfect within
themselves, serene and elegant, their purpose self-evident. Truly, he has
entered the mystery of Tao."
